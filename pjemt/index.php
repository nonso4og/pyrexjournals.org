		All articles that are submitted to this journal are made to undergo sectioning to ensure that they are in line with the scope of PJEMT and as well as the instructions for authors. Thereafter they are double-blindedly peer-reviewed by both internal and external reviewers. More than 100 reviewers are working diligently to shorten the review cycle of the academic research publication; and help researchers to pay more attention on the research itself, not waiting for too long, for suggestions from reviewers.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			To be accepted, a paper must be judged to be truly outstanding in its field and to be of interest to a wide audience. The primary criteria during the review and selection process of the submitted papers are; sound theoretical basis, valid empirical application and analysis, and contribution to the fields of agriculture. The primary criteria in the final selection of the papers once the review process is complete are quality, originality, and relevance to the international agricultural fields.
			</p>
